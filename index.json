	"content": "1. Background \u0026amp; Motivation 1.1 Executive Summary Customer Background The customer is FPT University HCMC (Academic Board) under the mentorship of Nguyễn Gia Hưng and potential Traffic Enforcement Agencies. They seek a technological demonstration of how IoT and Cloud Computing can solve real-world problems in traffic monitoring. The current manual alcohol inspection process suffers from a lack of operator verification, data fragmentation, and low public transparency.\nBusiness \u0026amp; Technical Objectives Team SPICA proposes a solution named \u0026ldquo;IoT-Based Alcohol Violation Detection System\u0026rdquo; to modernize this workflow. The core objectives include:\nAccountability: Eliminate unauthorized device usage by enforcing Biometric Authentication (Fingerprint) for every session. Transparency: Empower citizens to verify their own violation records via a secure Public Web Portal. Operational Excellence: Replace manual paperwork with an automated, immutable Serverless Cloud Database. Key Use Cases Secure Device Activation: Field officers must scan their fingerprint on the ESP32 Edge Device. The system authenticates against a central DynamoDB pool via AWS IoT Core before enabling the sensors. Multi-Sensor Data Collection: The device captures Alcohol Concentration (MQ-3) and Health Metrics (Heart Rate/SpO2 via MAX30102) simultaneously to ensure the subject\u0026rsquo;s safety during testing. Real-Time Violation Logging: Violation data is encrypted and synced instantly to AWS, accessible via a Dashboard for admins and a Lookup Portal for citizens. 1.2 Project Success Criteria To be considered successful, the system must meet the following quantitative metrics:\nMetric Target Notes Authentication Latency \u0026lt; 2 seconds Round-trip time from Fingerprint Scan $\\to$ Cloud Auth $\\to$ Device Unlock. Data Integrity 99.9% Zero loss of violation records during network stability tests. Security Compliance 100% All Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) must pass tfsec scans in the CI/CD pipeline. Deployment Automation Fully Automated Backend deploys via Terraform + GitHub Actions; Frontend deploys via AWS Amplify. Cost Efficiency \u0026lt;$15 / month Operational costs on AWS for the pilot phase. 1.3 Assumptions \u0026amp; Constraints Hardware \u0026amp; Connectivity Device: The team has procured the ESP32 WROOM, AS608 (Fingerprint), MQ-3 (Alcohol), and MAX30102 (Pulse Oximeter) sensors. Network: The Edge Device is assumed to have access to a stable Wi-Fi network or mobile hotspot (4G) during operation. Technical Environment Cloud Access: Team SPICA has Administrator access to a dedicated AWS account for resource provisioning. Development Stack: Firmware: C++ / PlatformIO. Backend: Python (Lambda) \u0026amp; Terraform (IaC). Frontend: React/Vue.js hosted on S3/Amplify. Scope Limitations Legal Admissibility: This project is a technical Proof of Concept (PoC). The sensor readings are for demonstration purposes and are not legally binding in a real court of law without further industrial calibration. Physical Housing: The prototype will use a temporary 3D-printed or acrylic case, not an industrial IP67-rated enclosure. "

	"content": "Enhance Data Visibility with Cribl Search and Amazon Managed Grafana In today’s digital environment, organizations face challenges in managing the growing volume of operational data across their infrastructure—logs, metrics, and traces from applications and systems.\nThis information holds the key to deeper insights and performance improvement. However, to use it effectively, organizations need a scalable and customizable observability pipeline that can collect, process, and route data to the right destinations.\nCribl \u0026amp; Amazon Managed Grafana Cribl, an AWS APN partner, provides centralized data management and configurable routing solutions for large volumes of operational and security data.\nAmazon Managed Grafana is used to visualize data processed by Cribl, turning it into actionable dashboards with real-time insights.\nThe integration of Cribl Search with Amazon Managed Grafana enables more powerful monitoring and analysis, helping organizations make faster, more reliable, and large-scale data-driven decisions.\nKey Use Cases 1. Cloud infrastructure monitoring Cribl Search can query data from sources such as Amazon S3, Cribl Lake, Amazon Security Lake, or native AWS services through APIs, without requiring prior indexing. Results can then be sent via Cribl Stream to SIEM systems for analysis.\nGrafana is then used to build real-time dashboards showing resource usage, costs, and performance across AWS regions and related services.\n2. Application performance management Create application-specific dashboards: latency, error rates, user experience, with drill-down capabilities to analyze transactions in detail.\n3. Security operations Display security events via dedicated dashboards, improving incident response time and investigation. Cribl supports continuous monitoring of security events, compliance reporting, and enhanced threat detection.\nPrerequisites AWS account with administrative access Amazon S3 bucket (existing or newly created) and VPC Flow Logs with write access to the bucket Proper IAM configuration for users enabling flow logs Cribl Cloud account Implementation Steps 1. Configure API authentication Use API tokens to secure communication between Cribl and Amazon Managed Grafana. Access “API Credentials” in the Cribl dashboard to obtain Client ID, secret, etc.\n2. Install and configure the plugin Go to Amazon Managed Grafana \u0026gt; Plugins \u0026gt; “Add new connection” \u0026gt; search for “Cribl” plugin \u0026gt; add connection using Cribl details.\n3. Create your first visualization In Grafana, use the Query tab to run a sample query retrieving VPC Flow Logs from the last 15 minutes, grouped by log status every minute.\n4. Explore deeper with Table Search in Amazon Managed Grafana Switch from time-series chart to table view to see detailed log entries, identify anomalies, and trace requests. For example, query 1,000 records from a dataset to support investigations.\nCleanup and Cost Considerations Delete VPC Flow Logs and temporary S3 buckets when no longer needed. Remove unused Cribl configurations to avoid unnecessary costs. Conclusion The integration of Cribl and Amazon Managed Grafana creates a customizable observability pipeline that centralizes data management, enhances security and compliance, and provides visualized data to support actionable decisions. This solution is valuable for enterprises seeking large-scale observability that is future-ready.\n"

	"content": "Introduction to Automated Remediation Automated Remediation is the use of software and logical rules to detect and fix infrastructure issues without human intervention. They are critical components for building \u0026ldquo;self-healing\u0026rdquo; systems that minimize service downtime. Computing resources running in production may encounter unexpected issues (such as memory overflow, application crashes). Through the combination of Amazon CloudWatch (monitoring) and AWS Systems Manager (execution), the system can automatically respond to these issues immediately instead of waiting for engineers to handle them manually. Workshop Overview In this workshop, you will deploy a completely automated monitoring and issue remediation process.\nWeb-Server-Test is an EC2 Instance resource that acts as a test application server. A CloudWatch Agent has been installed and configured within this instance to collect memory (RAM) metrics – a metric not monitored by default by AWS. You will use the stress tool to simulate a memory overflow attack, causing the server to become unresponsive. EventBridge \u0026amp; Systems Manager simulate an automated operations team. A Rule is configured to listen for alerts from CloudWatch. When memory exceeds the safe threshold, the system will automatically trigger a restart command (Reboot) on the instance through Systems Manager Automation. This mechanism simulates rapid service recovery in real-world environments. In this workshop, we perform the Reboot action to see results immediately, but for production workloads, you can configure more complex procedures such as dumping RAM for error analysis before restarting or replacing instances with Auto Scaling.

	"content": "2. Solution Architecture 2.1 High-Level Architecture Diagram The solution leverages a Cloud-Native Serverless Architecture ensuring high scalability, low maintenance, and cost-efficiency. The system connects Edge IoT devices to a centralized AWS backend, protected by comprehensive security layers.\nCore Architectural Layers:\nEdge Layer: ESP32 microcontrollers interacting with biometric and environmental sensors. Ingestion \u0026amp; Compute Layer: AWS IoT Core for secure messaging and AWS Lambda for serverless business logic. Storage Layer: Amazon DynamoDB for fast, NoSQL data storage of officer registries and violation logs. Security \u0026amp; Delivery Layer: AWS WAF protecting Amplify, and API Gateway for secure backend access. DevOps Layer: Automated CI/CD using Terraform \u0026amp; GitHub Actions (Backend) and AWS Amplify (Frontend with built-in CloudFront CDN). 2.2 Technology Stack The system utilizes the following AWS Services and Hardware components:\nCategory Service / Component Purpose IoT \u0026amp; Ingestion AWS IoT Core Secure MQTT Broker (TLS 1.2) for device communication. Compute AWS Lambda (Python) Serverless functions: Authorize, ProcessViolation, GetDashboard, SearchByCCCD. Database Amazon DynamoDB Storage for DeviceOfficerMap_Pool and ViolationsDB (with Global Secondary Indexes). API Layer Amazon API Gateway Exposes secure REST API endpoints to the frontend. Security AWS WAF Protects Amplify hosting from web exploits. Frontend AWS Amplify Hosting (with built-in CloudFront CDN), CI/CD, and integration for the React/Vue SPA. Backend DevOps Terraform + GitHub Actions Infrastructure as Code deployment and CI/CD automation. Monitoring Amazon CloudWatch System logging, metrics, and error alarming. Edge Hardware Components Controller: ESP32 (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth enabled). Sensors: MQ-3: Alcohol Concentration detection. MAX30102: Heart Rate \u0026amp; SpO2 monitoring (Health safety). AS608: Optical Fingerprint Sensor (Biometric Auth). Interface: 4x4 Matrix Keypad and LCD 1602 Display. 2.3 Main Processing Flows A. Authentication Flow (Hybrid) Scan: Officer places finger on the AS608 sensor. Request: ESP32 sends the encrypted SlotID to AWS IoT Core via topic auth/request. Verify: IoT Core triggers the AuthorizeFunction Lambda. Query: Lambda checks the DeviceOfficerMap_Pool table in DynamoDB. Response: System returns an unlock or deny command. The device activates the MQ-3 sensor only upon success. B. Violation Recording Flow Measure: Once unlocked, the device continuously reads MQ-3 sensor data. Detect: If Alcohol Level \u0026gt; Threshold, the device locks and prompts for Citizen ID (CCCD). Input: Officer enters the citizen\u0026rsquo;s CCCD via the Keypad. Upload: Device constructs a JSON payload containing OfficerID, AlcoholLevel, Timestamp, and CCCD, sending it to violations/new. Process: IoT Core triggers ProcessViolationFunction to validate and write the record to ViolationsDB. C. Public Lookup Flow Search: Citizen enters their National ID (CCCD) on the Web Portal. API Call: The frontend requests GET /violations?cccd=... via API Gateway. Fetch: SearchByCCCDFunction queries DynamoDB GSIs. Display: Results are returned and displayed on the dashboard in \u0026lt; 1 second. 2.4 Security Considerations Network Security: All API endpoints are protected by AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to block SQL Injection and XSS attacks. Data Encryption: In-Transit: TLS 1.2 for MQTT and HTTPS for API calls. At-Rest: DynamoDB tables are encrypted using AWS KMS. Access Control: IAM Roles: Implementation of \u0026ldquo;Least Privilege\u0026rdquo; for all Lambda execution roles. Device Identity: X.509 Certificates unique to each ESP32 device. Privacy: Sensitive PII (Citizen ID) is handled securely with strict read access policies. "
